# Counters

## Introduction

In C++20, modules were introduced into the C++ language. Although in available compilers their implementation is not yet complete and in some aspects experimental, this assignment proposes acquainting oneself with this new language extension. The aim of this task is to learn about:

- The basics of using C++ modules.
- The paradigm of object-oriented programming in C++.

## Definition of a Counter and Types of Counters

A counter is a digital circuit that counts pulses arriving at its input. The counter has a pre-divider with a value `<P>`. After each counted pulse, the counter skips the next `<P>` pulses. The counter signals events when it reaches certain values. Both the counter values and the parameter `<P>` are integers in the range from 0 to `UINT64_MAX`.

There are several types of counters:

1. **Modulo Counter:**  
   This counter counts from zero to the maximum value `<M>`, and then starts counting again from zero. This counter signals an overflow event when its value goes from `<M>` to zero. If the maximum value equals zero, then the counter always remains at zero and reports an overflow with each counted pulse.

2. **Fibonacci Counter:**  
   This counter counts from zero to `UINT64_MAX`, then stops. It signals an event when its value reaches a Fibonacci number, that is, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

3. **Geometric-Decimal Counter:**  
   This counter counts in successive cycles from 0 to 9, then from 0 to 99, from 0 to 999, â€¦, from 0 to 999999999999, and then again from 0 to 9, etc. This counter signals an overflow event when its value changes from its maximum to zero.

## Task

Write a program that manages a collection of counters. The program reads data from standard input. A correct input line has one of the following formats:

- **Create Modulo Counter:**  
  `M <C> <P> <M>`  
  Creates a new modulo counter with number `<C>` and parameters `<P>`, `<M>`.

- **Create Fibonacci Counter:**  
  `F <C> <P>`  
  Creates a new Fibonacci counter with number `<C>` and parameter `<P>`.

- **Create Geometric-Decimal Counter:**  
  `G <C> <P>`  
  Creates a new geometric-decimal counter with number `<C>` and parameter `<P>`.

- **Delete Counter:**  
  `D <C>`  
  Deletes the counter with number `<C>`.

- **Print Counter:**  
  `P <C>`  
  Prints a line consisting of the letter `C`, a space, the counter number, a space, the value of that counter, and a newline.

- **Send Pulses:**  
  `A <T>`  
  Sends `<T>` pulses to all counters. This causes events generated by all counters (since the previous execution of this command, or since the program started if this is the first such command) to be printed to standard output. Each event is printed on a separate line ended by a newline. Each event consists of the letter `E`, a space, the number `<C>` of the counter reporting the event, a space, and the number of pulses since the previous execution of this command (or since the program started if this is the first execution). Events are printed in chronological order of their occurrence. Events reported at the same time are sorted in ascending order by the counter numbers that reported them. If there are no events, nothing is printed.

The initial value of a new counter is zero. The parameters `<C>`, `<P>`, `<M>`, and `<T>` are integers in the range from 0 to `UINT64_MAX`.

The command name and its parameters are separated by a single space. Input lines are separated by newline characters. A newline after the last line is optional. The valid input data does not contain any white-space characters other than those mentioned above.

## Error Handling

The program continuously checks whether the input data contain errors. For each erroneous line, the program prints the following diagnostic message to standard output:

```
ERROR L
```

where `L` represents the line number (with numbering starting at 1). The error message ends with a newline. The program ignores the contents of erroneous lines.

A line is considered erroneous if there is an attempt to create a new counter when a counter with the given number already exists, or an attempt to delete a counter that does not exist.
